# What? 

---

HappyShield is a new **open-source** design for a **simple, foldable face shield** for infection control developed **in response to the Covid-19 pandemic**. 

**_Update: HappyShield, as manufactured by the University of Cambridge Department of Architecture using the "Laser-cut and Pressure Creasing" manufacturing method, has now recieved CE marking certification. Please note this approval applies only in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, and does not apply to other manufacturing methods, and production by manufacturers other than the University of Cambridge Department of Architecture. If you do manufacture and distribute face shields based on the HappyShield design, please know that the University of Cambridge and the University of Queensland will not accept any liability related to this. Please also note that you as a manufacturer are responsible for obtaining and maintaining the relevant approvals for manufacturing and distribution in your jurisdiction. Furthermore, as a manufacturer, you are responsible for maintaining your own suitable insurance appropriate for your activities manufacturing and distributing face shields._**

---

# Why?

---

Healthcare workers need face shields in addition to masks and goggles to provide protection from splashes and sprays of infected bodily fluids from Covid-19 patients during a number of high-risk medical procedures and situations. There is currently a **significant shortage of face shields globally**, which is likely to be **particularly severe in less wealthy regions** without the ability to buy or manufacture necessary Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as easily or quickly as wealthy countries. 

---

# How? 

---

The aim of this project is to develop a set of designs for face shields which are **safe**, **cheap**, **easy to mass-produce** quickly using **materials, equipment, and labour available in low and middle-income regions**, are **easy to reuse**, and are **comfortable** enough to be worn for extended periods by healthcare workers without inducing pain or discomfort. This effort has yielded **HappyShield**, which successfully meets these design goals. The features of the HappyShield design are listed below:

---

## Features

---

* Single-sheet fluid-impermeable design with **extra protection from fluids and sprays from above**.   

---

* Easy **decontamination for reuse** over high numbers of shifts.   

---

* Form-fitting and adjustable shape allowing for **comfortable wearing for extended periods**.   

---

* **Fast, flexible and scaleable mass-manufacturing approaches** to help meet global demand despite supply chain disruptions.
