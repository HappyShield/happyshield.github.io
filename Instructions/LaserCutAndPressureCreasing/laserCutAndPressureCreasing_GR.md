## 3-Part Press Jig

Κατεβάστε το αρχείο από τον υπολογιστή σας.
Download the laser-cutting template for the 3-part press jig which fits the bed of your laser-cutting machine. (The dimensions of the cutting templates are given in the filenames.) 
Choose any sheet material at least 4 mm deep with hardness similar to MDF or other wood, fibre, or plastic products for use in the jig. Laser-cut the sheet material using the template file, ensuring that your laser-cutter power and speed settings ensure a cut completely through the depth of the material.

Remove the 3 parts of the press jig from the laser-cutter. Select a metal wire between 1-3 mm in diameter. Cut the wire to the length of the dashed curves in parts A and C of the template.
Tape the metal wire onto the dashed curve the groove of the parts A and C of the press jig, being sure not to deviate from the dashed curve, and not to extend beyond the ends of the dashed curve.

Attach Part B to top A using short wood screws, or any other method. Attach the combined Part A and B to a block as needed to distribute pressure evenly across the jig surface. Do the same for Part C.

## Shield

# 1

Download the HappyShield laser-cutting template which fits in the bed of your laser-cutting machine. (The dimensions of the cutting templates are given in the filenames.)

Choose a flexible transparent sheet material for cutting. (These instructions have been tested for 0.5 mm PET and 0.5 mm acetate.) Laser-cut the sheet material using the template file, ensuring that your laser-cutter power and speed settings ensure a cut completely through the depth of the material.

Once cut, remove the resulting shields and friction clips from the laser-cutter bed. If desired, wipe the edges of the shields and clips with alcohol, or wash with any soap to remove any laser-cutting residues from the sheet.

Insert shield into the 3-part press jig and press to create the curved creases.

Cut a 400 mm length of elastic strap. Thread the strap through the friction clips on both ends.

Pass the threaded friction clips through the holes in the shield from back to front.
